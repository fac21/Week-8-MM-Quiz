# Week-8-MM-Quiz
- we have searched to get some idea and we have checked some APIs and we came across the quize idea . To fetch API with random question and for being intractive we decided to do let the user do the quize and if they get a certain score we will give bonus time to them . 

- We’ll be using Vite to handle bundling our app and providing a dev server. You can quickly scaffold a new app using their CLI:

npm init @vitejs/app
Follow the instructions in your Terminal (pick the react option)
cd [my-app-name]
npm install to install the dependencies
npm run dev start the dev server
Open the project in your editor—you should see an example app setup. Feel free to delete the logo/CSS files that you won’t be using.
