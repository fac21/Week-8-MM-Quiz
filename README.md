# Week-8-MM-Quiz
- we have searched to get some idea and we have checked some APIs and we came across the quize idea . To fetch API with random question and for being intractive we decided to do let the user do the quize and if they get a certain score we will give bonus time to them . 

- We’ll be using Vite to handle bundling our app and providing a dev server. You can quickly scaffold a new app using their CLI:

1- npm init @vitejs/app
2- Follow the instructions in your Terminal (pick the react option)
3- cd [my-app-name]
4- npm install to install the dependencies
5- npm run dev start the dev server
6- Open the project in your editor—you should see an example app setup. Feel free to delete the logo/CSS files that you won’t be using.
