# Week-8-MM-Quiz
- We searched for some ideas for apps we could build quickly wuith limited experience with React. We checked some APIs and decided on making a quiz after finding a suitable site. To make the app more interactive, we discussed the possibility of implementing a feature whereby if the user achieved a certain score, they we will receive 'bonus' time to complete the quiz. To achieve this, we used React Hooks such as 'UseState' and 'UseEffect'.

- We’ll be using Vite to handle bundling our app and providing a dev server. You can quickly scaffold a new app using their CLI:
# Setup
1- npm init @vitejs/app
2- Follow the instructions in your Terminal (pick the react option)
3- cd [my-app-name]
4- npm install to install the dependencies
5- npm run dev start the dev server
6- Open the project in your editor – you should see an example app setup. Feel free to delete the logo/CSS files that you won’t be using.
